For each describe "where" I am, and what commands I ran to get there:

Bill-MacBook:home mac$ -> you are in a folder called home. you have ran cd filepath to home
vagrant@scotchbox:~$ -> you are in the scotchbox secure ssh tunnel. you have run vagrant ssh.
root@scotchbox:/var$ -> you are in the scotchbox root folder.
mysql > -> you are in MySQL. you have run mysql -u root -proot
